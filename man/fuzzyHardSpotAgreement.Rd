\usage{
fuzzyHardSpotAgreement(
  hardPred,
  hardTruth,
  fuzzyTruth,
  useNegatives = TRUE,
  verbose = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{hardPred}{A vector of predicted cluster labels}

\item{hardTruth}{A vector of true cluster labels}

\item{fuzzyTruth}{A object coercible to a numeric matrix with membership
probability of elements (rows) in clusters (columns). Must have the same
number of rows as the length of \code{hardTruth}.}

\item{useNegatives}{Logical; whether to include negative pairs in the
agreement score (tends to result in a larger overall agreement and lower
dynamic range of the score). Default TRUE.}

\item{verbose}{Logical; whether to print expected memory usage for large
datasets.}
}
\value{
A numeric vector of agreement scores for each element of \code{hardPred}
}
\description{
Per-spot maximal agreement between a hard clustering and hard and fuzzy
ground truth labels.
}
