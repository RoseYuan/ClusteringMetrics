\arguments{
\item{x}{Either an igraph object, a list of nearest neighbors (see details
below), or a data.frame or matrix (with features as columns and items as
rows) from which nearest neighbors will be computed.}

\item{labels}{Either a factor or a character vector indicating the true class
label of each element (i.e. row or vertex) of \code{x}.}

\item{metrics}{The metrics to compute. See details.}

\item{directed}{Logical; whether to compute the metrics in a directed fashion.
If left to NULL, conventional choices will be made per metric (adhesion,
cohesion, PWC AMSP undirected, others directed).}

\item{...}{Passed to other methods}

\item{k}{The number of nearest neighbors to compute and/or use. Can be
omitted if \code{x} is a graph or list of nearest neighbors.}

\item{shared}{Logical; whether to use a shared nearest neighbor network
instead of a nearest neighbor network. Ignored if \code{x} is not an embedding
or dist object.}

\item{BNPARAM}{A BiocNeighbors parameter object to compute kNNs. Ignored
unless the input is a matrix or data.frame. If omitted, the Annoy
approximation will be used if there are more than 500 elements.}
}
\value{
A data.frame of metrics for each node/element of \code{x}.
}
\description{
Computes a selection of supervised graph evaluation metrics using ground
truth class labels. The metrics are reported (as average) per node/element.

\examples{
# generate random data and labels:
dat <- matrix(rnorm(300), nrow=30)
dat[1:10,1:3] <- dat[1:10,1:3]+2
labels <- rep(LETTERS[1:3], each=10)
# compute graph metrics:
head(getGraphElementMetrics(dat, labels, k=4))
