# Getting started

A partition is a way of organizing a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping, and non-empty subsets. For example, a clustering is a partition. This package provides multiple approaches for comparing two partitions of the same dataset, and evaluating the alignment between a datasetâ€™s embedding/graph representations and its partition.

Unlike a hard partition, a fuzzy partition allows data points to belong to multiple subsets with varying degrees of membership. This package further offers methods for comparing two fuzzy partitions as well as for comparing a hard partition with a fuzzy partition.

Additionally, spatial clustering can be evaluated by evaluating the hard or fuzzy partitions, or by using internal metrics. This package provides functions for all these types of analysis.

## Installation

```{r, eval=FALSE}
if (!requireNamespace("devtools", quietly = TRUE))
    install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("RoseYuan/ClusteringMetrics")
```

## Example data

To showcase the main functions, we will use an example object which contains (a 
subset of) RNAseq of mouse hippocampi after Forskolin-induced long-term 
potentiation:

```{r}
suppressPackageStartupMessages({
