The `poem` package provides multiple approaches for comparing two partitions[^1] of the same dataset, and evaluating the alignment between a datasetâ€™s embedding/graph representations and its partition.

Besides, this package further offers methods for comparing two fuzzy partitions[^2] as well as for comparing a hard partition with a fuzzy partition. This allows the evaluation of fuzzy partition results by assessing its agreement to a fuzzy or a hard ground-truth partition.

Finally, the package implements visualization and evaluation metrics tailored for domain detection in spatially-resolved -omics data.
These include especially external evaluation metrics (i.e. based on a comparison to ground truth labels), but also internal metrics. 

[^1]: A partition is a way of organizing the data points of a dataset into distinct, non-overlapping, and non-empty subsets. For example, a clustering is a partition. 

[^2]: In 'hard' partitions, each data point belongs to one and only one subset. However, clustering can also generate fuzzy partitions, in which data points can belong to multiple subsets with varying degrees (or probability) of membership.
