# ClusteringMetrics
## Installation
For now the package is not public yet, so you cannot install directly from github. you need to:
1. Download the repo.
2. Run `install.packages(path_to_dir, repos = NULL, type="source")` in R by replacing `path_to_dir` with the location of the repo in your local computer.

See the vignette for some introduction.

Please note that the name of the package will be changed.
