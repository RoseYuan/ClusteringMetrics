This package provides multiple approaches for comparing two (fuzzy or hard) partitions of the same dataset, and evaluating the alignment between a datasetâ€™s embedding/graph representations and its partition.
In addition, the package implements visualization and evaluation metrics tailored for domain detection in spatially-resolved -omics data.
These include especially external evaluation metrics (i.e. based on a comparison to ground truth labels), but also internal metrics. 
See the vignette for some introduction.
